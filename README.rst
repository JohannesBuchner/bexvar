bexvar
==================

Bayesian excess variance for Poisson data time series with backgrounds.
Excess variance is over-dispersion beyond the observational poisson noise,
caused by an astrophysical source.

Introduction
-------------------

In high-energy astrophysics, the analysis of photon count time series
is common. Examples include the detection of gamma-ray bursts,
periodicity searches in pulsars, or the characterisation of
damped random walk-like accretion in the X-ray emission of
active galactic nuclei.

Methods
--------------

This repository provides new statistical analysis methods for light curves.
They can deal with

* very low count statistics (0 or a few counts per time bin)
* (potentially variable) instrument sensitivity
* (potentially variable) backgrounds, measured simultaneously in an 'off' region.

The tools can read eROSITA light curves. Contributions that can read other
file formats are welcome.

The `bexvar_ero.py` tool computes posterior distributions on the Bayesian excess variance,
and source count rate.

`quick_ero.py` computes simpler statistics, including Bayesian blocks,
fraction variance, the normalised excess variance, and 
the amplitude maximum deviation statistics.
